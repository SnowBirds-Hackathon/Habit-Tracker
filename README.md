# Habit-Tracker
Codedex's 24-hour Hackathon (Snowbirds) Habit Tracker

This is a habit-tracking website that utilizes local storage. It was built using vanilla JS framework alongside Tailwind CSS framework and HTML

## How It's Made:

Tech Used: VS CODE (Live Collaboration) HTML, JS, CSS, Trello, Excalidraw, Vanilla JS framework and Tailwind CSS Framework

We created a flowchart to visualize what the website was going to look like, we included basic functionalities we would implement, as well as some other ideas we might look into if we have the time to implement them.

The planning stage helped us during the implementation stage because, we were able to work quickly on what we needed. We knew what we had to create and therefore spent less time thinking of what to implement and more time problem-solving. Along the way, we made some adjustments whenever we found something that could work instead of what we originally intended.  We used Discord as a form of communication and we delegated tasks based on the issues we ran into. The team was able to complement each other in areas that each team member lacked.


## Issues we ran Into and plan on finding solutions to

- We initially wanted to make a blurred background with a blob on the webpage, this proved difficult because it was our first time participating in a hackathon and we didn't have a lot of technical knowledge, and the time to fully research how to implement it.
 
- Local Storage persistence: After the completion of the design stage, we needed to work on the backend side. We chose to use local storage over User Authentication. The team agreed that for time's sake it would be quicker to store the habits on the user's local device. At first, we ran into implementation issues of making the checkmarks persist when the page was reloaded but thankfully, Chris came up with a solution and we got that functionality working.
  
- We wanted to implement a streak counter with a fire emoji that turns bright orange as the streak grows, we got the emoji on the page, the count work, but we weren't able to implement the color function and we weren't able to complete the local storage functionality of the streaks



## Lessons Learned
- Planning your project saves a lot of time
- Asking for help is important
- Testing things out in your personal sandbox is very useful to not break the main project
- There's always a solution or an alternate approach to your proposal
- Taking breaks helps to refresh your mental function
- Sleep is Important
- Always Proofread
